# AI Games Generation System

Automated creation of Games directory structure based on human initialization responses.

## Generation Algorithm

### Phase 1: Directory Structure Creation
```bash
# Base structure
mkdir -p Games/Game-Instances
mkdir -p Games/Active-Environment
mkdir -p Games/Cast

# Conditional structures
if [multiple_subjects_planned]; then
  mkdir -p Games/Global-Avatar-Status
fi
```

### Phase 2: Game Instance Generation
Based on subject selection, create appropriate game structure:

```yaml
game_instance_template:
  folder_name: "[X.X]-[Subject]-[Focus-Area]"
  structure:
    - README.md (game overview)
    - Sessions/ (daily learning logs)
    - Degrees/ (skill progressions)
    - Migrations/ (game evolution)
    - Cast/ (instance-specific mentors)
    - Environment/ (context settings)
```

### Phase 3: Content Generation Templates

#### README.md Generation
```markdown
# [Game Title] Learning Game

## Objective
[Generated based on subject + skill level + goals]

## Your Learning Path
[Customized curriculum based on responses]

## Cast Members
- **Primary Mentor**: [Selected mentor with reasoning]
- **Environmental Context**: [Selected environment with reasoning]
- **Technical Support**: [Appropriate spirits based on tech preferences]

## Game Mechanics
[XP system calibrated to time commitment and learning style]
```

#### Session Template Generation
Based on learning style preference:

**Project-Based Learner:**
```markdown
## Session Structure
1. **Build Phase** (60%): Hands-on construction
2. **Reflection Phase** (25%): Understanding concepts
3. **Planning Phase** (15%): Next iteration setup
```

**Theory-First Learner:**
```markdown
## Session Structure
1. **Concept Phase** (40%): Understanding fundamentals
2. **Application Phase** (45%): Implementing concepts
3. **Integration Phase** (15%): Connecting to prior knowledge
```

### Phase 4: Cast Assignment Algorithm

```yaml
mentor_selection:
  subject_mapping:
    vue_js: dr_elena_vasquez # Mobile-first focus
    react: prof_marcus_chen # Architecture focus
    design: dr_amira_hassan # Creative integration
    business: dr_david_wilson # Strategy focus
  
  style_modifier:
    mathematical_precision: elena_vasquez
    systems_thinking: marcus_chen
    creative_integration: amira_hassan
    research_methodology: phd_degree
```

### Phase 5: Environment Context Setup

```yaml
environment_activation:
  geographic:
    urban_creative: "NYC_soho_studio"
    natural_focus: "mountain_cabin"
    academic: "the_new_school_parsons"
  
  atmospheric:
    productive: "morning_fog"
    creative: "thunderstorm"
    intensive: "blizzard_focus"
  
  historical:
    modern_frameworks: "2020s_reactive_era"
    design_systems: "swiss_design_1950s"
    experimental: "bauhaus_1920s"
```

### Phase 6: XP System Calibration

```yaml
xp_calculation:
  time_commitment:
    casual_2_3_hours: 
      session_xp: 50
      degree_threshold: 300
    regular_5_7_hours:
      session_xp: 75
      degree_threshold: 450
    intensive_10_plus:
      session_xp: 100
      degree_threshold: 600
  
  difficulty_scaling:
    beginner: 1.0x
    some_experience: 1.2x
    intermediate: 1.5x
    advanced: 2.0x
```

## Generation Process Flow

1. **Parse Human Responses**
   - Extract preferences and requirements
   - Validate compatibility
   - Identify any missing information

2. **Create Directory Structure**
   - Generate base Games/ folders
   - Create first game instance folder
   - Set up supporting directories

3. **Generate Content Files**
   - Custom README with personalized objectives
   - Session templates matching learning style
   - Degree progression appropriate to skill level
   - Cast assignments with reasoning

4. **Activate Environment**
   - Set geographic/atmospheric context
   - Configure appropriate spirits
   - Establish mentor voice calibration

5. **Initialize Progress Tracking**
   - Create first session placeholder
   - Set XP baseline
   - Configure achievement milestones

## Quality Assurance Checks

Before finalizing generation:
- [ ] All selected preferences reflected in structure
- [ ] Cast assignments logical and helpful
- [ ] XP system matches time commitment
- [ ] Environment supports chosen learning style
- [ ] Templates ready for immediate use

## Error Handling

```yaml
fallback_strategies:
  incomplete_responses: use_schema_defaults
  conflicting_preferences: prioritize_learning_style
  unsupported_combinations: suggest_alternatives
  technical_errors: create_minimal_viable_structure
```

## Integration Points

- Link to [[../../Variables/Cast/Defaults/|Cast Catalogs]]
- Connect to [[../../Variables/Goals/|Goal Templates]]
- Reference [[../../../Games/|Generated Structure]]

## README Update Protocol

**Always update Games/README.md after generation:**

```yaml
required_updates:
  front_matter:
    status: "active"
    initialization_status: "completed"
    last_updated: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
    active_games:
      - name: "[Generated Game Name]"
        created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
        status: "ready-to-start"
        next_session: "Session 1: [First Topic]"
        progress: "0/[Target XP]"
        mentor: "[Assigned Mentor Name]"
        environment: "[Selected Environment]"

  content_sections:
    status_line: "ðŸŸ¢ Active - 1 Game Ready to Start"
    active_games_list: "[Generated game with brief description]"
    quick_actions: "[Links to first session, mentor intro, environment]"
    progress_summary: "[Initial XP: 0, Sessions: 0, Streak: 0]"
```

**Template for Updated README:**
```markdown
---
type: games-hub
status: active
initialization_status: completed
last_updated: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
active_games:
  - name: "[Game Instance Name]"
    created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
    status: "ready-to-start"
    progress: "0/[Target]"
