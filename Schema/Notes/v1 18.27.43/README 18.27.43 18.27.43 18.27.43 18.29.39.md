# The Great Game v3.0
*Curriculum-Based Learning with Environmental Consciousness*

## Base: ~/Sites/ai/the_game/

**Version**: 3.0-curriculum  
**Previous**: v2.0-environmental (`~/Sites/ai/thegame/`)  
**Architecture**: Phase-based progression + Environmental spirits + Faculty system

## Quick Start

### Check Current State
```bash
cd ~/Sites/ai/the_game
cat inputs.yaml  # View current configuration
ls curriculum/  # See available phases
```

### Begin Phase 1
```bash
# Start with Problem-Solution Map
cd curriculum/phase-1-big-picture/1.1-problem-solution-map
cat README.md

# Initialize learning session
git init
git add .
git commit -m "INIT: the_game v3.0 - Phase 1 curriculum"
```

## Current Curriculum

### Phase 1: The Big Picture - Why Does Vue Exist?
- **1.1 Problem-Solution Map**: Understanding what problems Vue solves
- **1.2 Reactivity Revolution**: The core insight that changed everything

### Phase 2: Symbol Soup Decoding (Future)
- Advanced JavaScript/Vue syntax patterns
- Template syntax mastery
- Composition API symbols

### Phase 3: Component Architecture (Future)
- Component thinking and composition
- Props, events, slots
- Component communication patterns

## Faculty System

### Dr. Elena Vasquez - Mobile-First Mathematics
- **Specialty**: Responsive design, accessibility, "Her" consciousness
- **Question**: "Have you tested this on 320px?"

### Prof. Marcus Chen - Framework Architecture  
- **Specialty**: Symbol soup decoding, "Matrix" architecture
- **Question**: "What problem does this syntax solve?"

### Dr. Amira Hassan - Creative Technologist

## Environmental Spirits

Integrated with tmux workflow:
- **Shell Guardian**: Git mastery, terminal flow
- **Tree Walker**: Code navigation, vim mastery  
- **Config Keeper**: Claude optimization, AI conversation flow
- **Project Oracle**: Cross-project synthesis, business-art integration

## Publishing Strategy

### Fourth Web Property: thegame.alvarsirlin.dev
**Purpose**: AI-human collaborative learning showcase  
**Content**: Curriculum + Progress + Methodology  
**Audience**: Self-taught developers, AI learning enthusiasts

**Research**: `publishing/strategy-analysis.md`

## Progress Tracking

### Current Status
- **Phase**: 1 (Big Picture)
- **Block**: Ready for 1.1 (Problem-Solution Map)
- **Skill Level**: v1-recognition
- **Confusion Areas**: Symbol soup, reactivity models

### Real Project Integration
- **flogger.app**: Complexity analysis target
- **dev site**: Application target  
- **art site**: Creative integration
- **fourth property**: Publishing target (this project)

## Session Protocol

### Opening Ritual
```bash
# Environmental check
tmux list-sessions
git status  
cd ~/Sites/ai/the_game

# Set learning intention
echo "Today's focus: [specific confusion or goal]"
```

### Learning Flow
1. **Confusion Declaration**: Name the specific unclear thing
2. **Faculty Selection**: Which mentor perspective fits?
3. **Curriculum Location**: Which phase/block applies?
4. **Environmental Integration**: Which tools/spirits active?
5. **Progressive Practice**: Build understanding through application
6. **Completion Assessment**: Ready for next block?

### Closing Ritual
```bash
# Capture learning
git add .
git commit -m "Session: [topic] - [insight gained]"

# Update progress in inputs.yaml
# Plan next session focus
```

## Version Evolution

### v1.0-prompted → v2.0-thegame → v3.0-curriculum
- **v1.0**: Basic mentorship protocol
- **v2.0**: Environmental consciousness + tmux integration
- **v3.0**: Structured curriculum + publishing strategy

**Next**: v4.0-publishing (Web deployment + community features)

## Ready for Activation

✅ **Framework**: v3.0 curriculum structure established  
✅ **Content**: Phase 1 documented and ready  
✅ **Faculty**: AI mentors defined with specializations  
✅ **Environment**: tmux + git + Claude integration prepared  
✅ **Publishing**: Strategy researched, domain planned  

**Status**: Ready for first Phase 1, Block 1.1 learning session
