# AI instructions
- Before a task:
	- check this file for changes
	- always think of improvements in structure and content and add to *MIGRATIONS*
	- document any new prefs in .claude/ in Schema/ 
	- scan the filetree to see if I've made any changes: learn and update documentation 
- always update Schema/*CHANGELOG*
- refer to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- always play a sound when in put is needed
- don't ask for permission to run shellscript that only affect files $ROOT = ~/Sites/ai/the_game 
- this game should be applicable across many knowledge domains and exploration, not just programming
-  suggest other obsidian tools, programming languages, frameworks, paradigms etc
