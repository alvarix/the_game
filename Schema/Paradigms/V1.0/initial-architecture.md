# Paradigm Shift: V1.0 - Initial Learning Game Architecture

## Summary
Established foundational architecture for domain-agnostic learning game system with avatar progression, session tracking, and schema-driven structure.

## Key Changes
- **Added**: Complete Games and Schema folder structures
- **Added**: Migration scripts for automated deployment
- **Added**: Obsidian integration with front matter and wiki-links
- **Added**: Avatar-based progress tracking system
- **Added**: Domain-agnostic learning support
- **Enhanced**: AVATAR.md with structured learning status

## Context
Built from analysis of Schema/README.md requirements and existing Notes iterations. Needed systematic approach to track learning across multiple knowledge domains beyond just programming.

## Impact
- **Technical**: Established repeatable migration pattern and comprehensive data schemas
- **User Experience**: Clear progression system with XP, degrees, and session structure
- **Future Implications**: Foundation for interactive game instances and AI summarization strategies

## Conversation Summary
Analyzed requirements from multiple perspectives (technical, project management, UX). Created migration scripts for Games (avatar tracking, session management) and Schema (init scripts, data models). Implemented Obsidian Extended Markdown with front matter properties and wiki-links. Formatted AVATAR.md for consistency and established paradigm tracking system.
