Global instructions:
- always update Schema/*CHANGELOG*
- when a paradigm shift occurs tag and version
- always think of improvements in structure and content and add to *MIGRATIONS*
- refer to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- always play a sound when in put is needed
- don't ask for permission to run shellscript that only affect files $ROOT = ~/Sites/ai/the_game 
- this game should be applicable across many knowledge domains and exploration, not just programming
- eventually i'd like to make different game instances interactive

V1
I am building a game for learning. 
Obsidian md files: $ROOT 
Obsidian is meant to track game instances and progress. 
Also versioned in Git, primarily to track the substrata. 
Inside of *Schema/Notes* are some past iterations of brainstorming that you should reference.

# Step 1
In this first version I'd like you to create scripts in /Schema/Migrations that create or update:
1. Games
	1. tree structure described in *Schema/V1 structure.md*
	2. md file in each of those folders with a proposed data structure (see /AVATAR.md) and using Obsidian Extended Markdown to create connections between notes and taking advantage of other interesting features like front matter properties. 
	3. README.md for instructions and tips
2. Schema
	1. same as games
	2. prompt for guidance
3. craft a git commit message
