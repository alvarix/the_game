V1
I am building a game for learning. 
Obsidian md files: $ROOT 
Obsidian is meant to track game instances and progress. 
Also versioned in Git, primarily to track the substrata. 
Inside of *Schema/Notes* are some past iterations of brainstorming that you should reference.

# Step 1
In this first version I'd like you to create scripts in /Schema/Migrations that create or update:
1. Games
	1. tree structure described in *Schema/V1 structure.md*
	2. md file in each of those folders with a proposed data structure (see /AVATAR.md) and using Obsidian Extended Markdown to create connections between notes and taking advantage of other interesting features like front matter properties. 
	3. README.md for instructions and tips
2. Schema
	1. same as games
	2. prompt for guidance
3. craft a git commit message
